# Overview

This progrma provides the user with a working To-Do list. It allows the user to create a To-Do list name, add and remove list items, view their list, as well as allow the user to mark an item as "DONE". The program also utilizes a class to allow the user to create a username and password. This program makes use of a mutable list to store the To-Do list items. With this software, I have attempted to cover many contingencies where the user may attempt to "break" the program.

This program was create to showcase my learning/understanding of the Kotlin language basics - using variables (mutable and immutable), expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, and classes. I also implemented the use of the keyword "when" to show understanding of its usage.
